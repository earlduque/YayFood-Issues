# YayFood 1.3.0 Release Notes

## What's New

### Restaurant Thumbnails
The restaurant list now shows a photo preview alongside each restaurant:

- **Dish Photo Thumbnails**: The highest-rated dish photo for a restaurant appears as a small thumbnail in the restaurant list, so you can recognize your favorites at a glance
- **Colorful Fallback**: When no dish photos exist, a color-coded letter circle shows the restaurant's initial instead

### Notes Are Now Searchable
Your private notes are no longer invisible to search:

- **Search within notes**: Typing in the search bar now finds restaurants and dishes by their note content, not just their names -- so searching "truffle" will surface a dish you wrote "amazing truffle flavor" about
- Applies to both the Restaurants tab and the Dishes tab

### Quick-Add Dishes
Quickly log dish names without the full form -- perfect for jotting down what's on the menu before you forget:

- **Inline quick-add**: Type a dish name directly in the restaurant detail view and tap send -- no need to open the full Add Dish form
- **Rapid multi-entry**: The text field stays focused after each submission so you can add several dishes in quick succession
- **Unrated placeholders**: Quick-added dishes appear as "unrated" and are excluded from restaurant scores, gallery, and analytics until you rate them
- **Rate later**: Tap any unrated dish to open its detail view with a prominent "Rate This Dish" button

## Bug Fixes

- **Delete confirmation in detail views**: The "Delete Restaurant" and "Delete Dish" actions in detail view menus now show a confirmation alert before deleting, matching the swipe-to-delete behavior in list views. The same confirmation was also added to the long-press context menu delete on dishes in restaurant detail view.

## Requirements

- **iOS**: 17.0 or later
- **Storage**: Minimal -- all photos stored locally with aggressive compression
- **Internet**: Only needed for optional Pexels image fetching -- everything else works offline
